                                of the utmost importance to us. To ensure this, VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC SCHOOL
                                has set up a dedicated, fully-functional healthcare centre staffed with a
                                qualified nurse. The nurse is present during school hours and attends to
                                day to day ailments, conducts regular health check-ups and holds workshops
                                on hygiene, sanitation and medical safety. In addition, there is also a
                                provision for a doctor on call, should the need arise for a doctor to be
                                present on campus. For emergencies and situations that are beyond the
                                scope of the healthcare centre, we have tied up with a leading hospital
                                located within 15 minutes from the school campus. VIKAS MANTRA PUBLIC
                                SCHOOL also has access to ambulance services from nearby hospitals for
                                any medical emergencies.
